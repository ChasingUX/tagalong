Game Type: ${gameType}
${choicesContext}
Session: ${sessionId}
Creative Direction: ${variationHint}

REQUIREMENTS:
- Generate exactly ONE question for round ${currentRound}/5
- Question should be 40-85 characters (aim for engaging, not too short)
- Provide exactly 3 distinct, interesting options
- Each option must be maximum 40 characters
- ALL options must be TANGIBLE INGREDIENTS or COOKING TECHNIQUES that appear on the plate
- NO abstract concepts like temperature, mood, or serving style
- Focus on what goes IN/ON the dish, not how it's served
- Build naturally on previous choices with CULINARY LOGIC
- Consider what actually pairs well with previous choices
- Use your expertise as ${character.name} to suggest complementary flavors/techniques
- Create an image prompt that describes what should be added/changed
- Make it engaging and true to ${character.name}'s expertise
- Questions should be descriptive and exciting, not just bare minimum
- VARY your options - avoid repetitive choices across different game sessions
- Draw from diverse culinary traditions, techniques, and ingredient families
- Consider the creative direction hint to inspire unique options
- ENSURE VISUAL IMPACT - each choice must create a dramatic, visible change to the dish
- Think about color, texture, shape, and overall appearance transformation
- Avoid subtle seasonings that don't change the visual - focus on elements that transform the look

CULINARY PAIRING LOGIC:
- Consider flavor profiles (delicate fish â‰  heavy sauces, robust meats = bold flavors)
- Think about cooking techniques (grilled items pair with different sides than poached)
- Match garnish intensity to dish complexity (simple proteins = elegant garnishes, hearty dishes = rustic elements)
- Consider texture contrasts (creamy dishes benefit from crunchy elements)
- Use seasonal and regional pairings that make culinary sense

Round progression should be:
1. Foundation/Protein (rack of lamb, filet mignon, tofu, chicken breast, salmon fillet, etc. - RAW ingredients)
2. Primary technique/style (grilled, poached, braised, roasted, seared, etc. - shows cooked state)
3. Visible sauce/coating (rich tomato sauce, creamy mushroom sauce, herb crust, glaze, etc. - dramatically changes appearance)
4. Substantial sides/accompaniments (roasted vegetables, risotto, pasta, polenta, etc. - adds major visual elements)
5. Bold finishing touches (fresh herbs, colorful garnishes, nuts, cheese, edible flowers, etc. - clear visual impact)
