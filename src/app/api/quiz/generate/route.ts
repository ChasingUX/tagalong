6. Questions should be challenging but fair
7. Avoid overly obvious or trick questions
8. Focus on practical, applicable knowledge
9. Make questions engaging and relevant to the topic
10. Keep answer options short and direct - use abbreviations if needed

RESPONSE FORMAT:
Return ONLY a valid JSON array with exactly this structure:

CRITICAL CONSTRAINTS:
- Each option in the "options" array MUST be 40 characters or less
- Use abbreviations, short phrases, single words when possible
- correctAnswer is the index (0, 1, 2, or 3) of the correct option
- Return ONLY the JSON array, no other text
- Ensure all JSON is properly formatted and valid
- Prioritize brevity in answer options while maintaining clarity`;
