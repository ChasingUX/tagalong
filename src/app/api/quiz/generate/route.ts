        correctAnswer: 1,
        explanation: "Saffron is known as the 'king of spices' due to its intense flavor, aroma, and high price. It's harvested from the flower of Crocus sativus and requires about 150 flowers to produce just 1 gram of saffron."

        correctAnswer: 2,
        explanation: "Poaching involves cooking food gently in liquid (water, broth, wine, etc.) at temperatures between 160-180°F (71-82°C), just below boiling. This method is perfect for delicate foods like eggs, fish, and fruits."

        correctAnswer: 1,
        explanation: "Curry powder is a spice blend that typically includes turmeric (giving it the yellow color), cumin, coriander, and various other spices. While garam masala is also important in Indian cuisine, curry powder is more universally recognized for these specific base ingredients."
